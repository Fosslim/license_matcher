# LicenseMatcher

LicenseMatcher is a rubygem that can match a fulltext of Opensource License Text with SPDX id; So you dont have to guess is it **BSD** or **MIT** license, let the `LicenseMatcher` does the heavy lifting for you;


It uses [Fosslim](https://github.com/Fosslim/fosslim/) library underneath, which gives remarkable performance with lower memory cost than pure Ruby implementation;

This Gem is designed to be high-level Ruby client for the Fosslim library and may probably never expose low-level functions for manipulating index or models;


To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'license_matcher'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install license_matcher

## Usage

run `bundle exec irb` on your commandline to fire up Ruby REPL;

```
require 'license_matcher'

# build index from SPDX data
LicenseMatcher.build_index( "data/licenses", "data/index.msgpack")

# match license text
txt = File.read("fixtures/files/mit.txt");
lm = LicenseMatcher.new("data/index.msgpack")
lm.match(txt, 0.9) 

```


## Development

Run `rake build` command to build native extension from Rust code;


After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
